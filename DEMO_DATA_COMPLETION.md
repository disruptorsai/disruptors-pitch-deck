## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "No pricing tiers available yet"

**Cause:** Migration not applied
**Fix:**
1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Run the migration file
3. Check for errors in output

### "No capabilities configured yet"

**Cause:** Sample data migration not applied first
**Fix:**
1. First apply `20250113_sample_data.sql`
2. Then apply `20250117_disruptors_complete_demo_data.sql`

### Diagnostic shows "Awaiting Analysis"

**This is normal!**
- Disruptors Media client has no competitive analysis (it's the agency)
- TechVenture Solutions has full analysis
- Switch active client in admin panel to see analysis

### Environment errors

**Cause:** Missing Supabase credentials
**Fix:** Verify `.env.local` has:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_key
```
